# datapackr 6.3.3

## New features
* 

## Bug fixes
* 

## Minor improvements and fixes
* Added `season` as a parameter in most unpacking and packing functions to better
align with new workflows â€” PSNUxIM tools separate, and both PSNUxIM tool & Data
Pack valid for both COP & OPU. This is in preparation for the deprecation of the
concept of a separate "OPU Tool", as this is now functionally identical to the
PSNUxIM tool used during main COP.

## Minor improvements and fixes
* Add additional unit tests to support COP 23
* Various formatting improvements as it relates to the exported file
* Updated valid Org Units and Dataset Levels. 


# datapackr 6.1.0

## Breaking changes
* Fixes issues with getMechanismView. The current implementation was too slow, and prone to timing out. The entire view will be downloaded (which is time consuming) once and then all filters happen on the full cached file.
* Fixes a bug with COP22 data element/category option combo maps. 50+ age bands were being dropped with full COP22 datapacks.

## New features
* Adds a check for defunct disaggregates in the PSNUxim tab.

# datapackr 5.3.2

## Breaking changes
* Removes `getFY22Prioritizations` in favor of clearer, more stable, internal functions.
* Replaces `getPSNUs` with with more versatile (and appropriately named)
`getDataPackOrgUnits`. Many of the org units used in Data Packs are actually not
PSNUs (e.g., DREAMS SNUs, or Military SNUs), making many of the columns created
previously less than sensible. This function now also produces a tibble instead
of a data frame. In some cases, column names in this output have also slightly
changed.
* Similarly, replaces `add_dp_psnu` with `add_dp_label`.
* `adorn_import_file` can now correctly assign prioritizations to org units below
PSNU (e.g., for DREAMS SNUs in Rwanda & Eswatini).

## New features
* Adds the functions `cache_is_fresh` and `fresh_cache_part` for use in 
anticipated functions allowing the caching of metadata objects retrieved from
the DATIM API, allowing faster processing for repeat requests.
* Adds the function `checkToolEmptySheets` to allow checking and unpacking
processes to detect sheets with either no rows of data, or no text in key header
columns (e.g., PSNU, Age, Sex, KeyPop). In these cases, unpacking and checking
functions cannot accurately assess data, so these sheets should be skipped. This
function results in updates in `unPackingChecks`, `unPackSheets`, and
`unPackDataPackSheet`.

## Minor improvements and fixes


# datapackr 5.3.0

## Breaking changes
* Removes the following functions from the package:
   - `checkComments`
   - `checkDuplicateRows`
   - `checkExternalLinks`
   - `checkMissingMetadata`
   - `checkNumericValues`
   - `checkStructure`
   - `compareTemplateToSchema`

* Refactors `packDataPack` and `packOPUDataPack` to work with new `packTool` wrapper function.
   - Common functionality is removed from individual functions and moved into `packTool` to remove duplication.
   - The `packDataPack` function now only takes in `d` and `d2_session` as arguments.
   - The `packOPUDataPack` function now takes in a `d` object, an `undistributed_mer_data` dataframe, and a `d2_session` object as arguments. When an `undistributed_mer_data` object is provided, it will use these target values for distributing rather than taking target values from DATIM.
   - Each function now checks if appropriate model filepath has been provided and then writes tabs into pre-generated file.

## New features
* Add the following functions, along with related tests:
   * `loadSheets`
   * `readSheet`
   * `checkFormulas`

   * `checkToolConnections` (instead of `checkExternalLinks`)
   * `checkToolComments` (instead of `checkComments`)
   * `checkSheets`
   * `extract_uid`
   * `extract_uid_all`
* Creates a new wrapper function `packTool` around `packDataPack` and `packOPUDataPack`
* Adds `checkOutputFolder` function to `check_params` set that validates that an output folder has been provided, that the directory exists, and can be written to.

## Minor improvements and fixes
* Refactors `unPackDataPackSheet` to reduce cyclomatic complexity and make it functional over multiple sheets at once.
* Updates `unPackDataPack` to use new check functions (see above).
* Updates `unPackTool` to use `loadDataPack` instead of `createKeychainInfo`.
* Simplifies and generalizes `unPackDataPackSheet`.

* Updates `createKeychainInfo` to be more accurate in deducing metadata from submitted Data Packs.
* Updates `loadDataPack` to be production ready.
* Refactors `packForDATIM` to streamline all related functions into one and removes `packForDATIM_MER`, `packForDATIM_OPU`, and `packForDATIM_UndistributedMER`. Updates related functions accordingly.
* Removes deprecated code for `exportSubnatToDatim` function.
* Removes deprecated `compareTemplateToSchema` function after removing last instance of usage in `packDataPack`.
* Creates `data-raw/COP21OPU_PSNUxIM_generation_from_Data_Pack.R` which allows the generation of a COP21 OPU tool that includes the target values from a COP21 Data Pack tool and the % distributions from DATIM.
* Fixes tests for the following functions:
   * `listWorkbookContents`
   * `packForDATIM`
   * `separateDataSets`
   * `unPackSheets`
   * `prepareMemoData`
   * `createAnalytics`

# datapackr 5.1.6

## Bug fixes
- Fixes mismatch between text and metadata on certain validation messages that caused some warnings to be highlighted red as if they were errors and caused some errors not to be highlighted red. (DP-523)
- Fixes missing PrEP_CT data on approval memo target tables. (DP-561)

# datapackr 5.1.2

## Bug Fixes
* Corrects the % of EID by 12 months from 95% (same as by 2 months) to 100%.
* Updates comments and conditional formatting in the Cascade Tab over HTS_INDEX yield columns to align with COP Guidance (<10% as warning, rather than 20%).

## New Features
* For COP22 Data Packs, enables appending data to the bottom of the PSNUxIM tab when data is detected in the main tabs of the Data Pack, but not reflected in the PSNUxIM tab.

# datapackr 5.1.1

## Bug fixes
* This maintenance release fixes a bug with `unPackCountryUIDs` that was introduced in v5.0.1 due to linting. This bug preventing the processing of COP and OPU tools in `datapackr-app` as well as broke the `createAnalytics` function for regional tools.

# datapackr 5.1.0

## Breaking changes
* The function `packForDATIM_UndistributedMER` now takes in arguments for MER data and COP year instead of an entire `d` object and returns a table of undistributed MER data rather than return a `d` object with data nested under `d$data$UndistributedMER`.

## New features
* Updates COP22 Data Pack template and processing code.
    - Removes "Summary" tab from COP22 tools and processing code.
    - Includes "Not PEPFAR" column to PSNUxIM tab and adds support for processing this data.
      Drops dataf from this column before creating the analytics table and MER exports.
* Adds item to `d` object for unallocated IMs nested under `d$info$unallocatedIMs`.

## Minor improvements and fixes
* Additional handling for default Category Option Combos.
* Adds dataset UIDs for COP22 to the `getDatasetUids` function.
* Updates `getMapDataPack_DATIM_DEs_COCs` to include handling for COP22 map.
* Adds test for `getDatasetUids`
* Adds explicit comparison checks when updating schemas and Data Pack-DATIM mapping files using the `waldo` package.

# datapackr 5.0.3

## New features
* Initial launch of COP22 Data Pack processing!

## Breaking changes
* Now requires R version 4.1.1 or higher.

## Minor improvements and fixes
* Updated and improved documentation of datasets in `datapackr`.
* Improves handling of default `categoryOptionCombo`.
* Improves documentation of `packDataPackSheet`, `packSheets`, and `prepareSheetData`.

## Deprecated features
* `loginToDATIM` is retired in favor of the same function in `datimutils`. All
  instances of this function being invoked have been replaced appropriately.
    - The functions `DHISLogin`, `GetCredentialsFromConsole`, `LoadConfigFile`,
      and `ValidateConfig` were not exported and are now deprecated as well.
      They were previously only used by `loginToDATIM`.
* `isLoggedIn` is retired as it was only used in `getMechList` and
  `loginToDATIM`.


# datapackr 5.0.2

## Bug fixes
* Resolves a bug with `packOPUDataPack` where `createDataPack` was not
implemented correctly in version 5.0.1.
* Patches a bug with `getOPUDataFromDATIM` where `getCOPDataFromDATIM` returns
a dataframe where the default Category Option Combo UID is listed as `default`
rather than the appropriate DATIM UID. This will be removed in favor of a more
permanent solution in future updates.

## New features
* Significantly improves handling of parameter checks and standardizes their
  validation and defaults. Documentation for these checks is also added.
* Adds functionality for producing COP22 Beta Packs and test data.

## Breaking changes
* Removes `getDataPackSchema` in favor of consolidated `pick_schema`.

## Deprecated features
* `getDataPackSchema` has been deprecated in favor of `pick_schema` and has been
replaced in the two locations where it was previously used.

## Minor improvements and fixes
* Improves and updates tests related to parameter checks and schemas.
* Introduces many new small utilities functions such as `%missing%` and `%||%`.
* Improves automation of Data Pack Template/schema validation.


# datapackr 5.0.1

## New features

* `loadDataPack` is a new function that returns a Data Pack object conserving
  styles and formatting of the original Data Pack .xlsx file, as well as other
  metadata necessary for processing and analysing data in the Data Pack.
* `.testInvalidIndicatorCodes` was previously an internal function that is now
  documented and exported by the package. This function tests for invalid
  indicator codes in a `d` Datapackr object.
* `datapack_cogs` is a new dataset containing Datapack Category option groups
  (id and name) along with their individual category options (id and name) as a
  nested data frame.


## Breaking changes

* `createWorkbook` has been renamed `createDataPack` to deconflict with the
  openxlsx function `createWorkbook`. This function now returns a `d`
  datapackr object rather than an openxlsx workbook object.
* The `d2_session` argument has been removed from the following functions:
    - `check_params`
    - `createDataPack` (previously `createWorkbook`)
    - `unPackSchema_datapack`


## Minor improvements and fixes

* `unPackSchema_datapack` was modified in the following ways:
    - Now uses the `datapack_cogs` data set rather than making a query to DATIM.
    - Inherits parameters from `datapackr_params`.
* `writeHomeTab` was modified in the following ways:
    - The `wb` and `datapack_name` arguments default to `NULL`.
    - Checks and assigns parameters using the `check_params` function.
    - Lists country names on the Home tab in addition to Country UIDs.
* Minor corrections were made to Excel functions written by `packSNUxIM` that
  had been erroneously changed during previous linting.
* Internal changes were made to variable names and functions used inside the
  `check_params` function.
* A new file has been added to `data-raw` to generate the `datapack_cogs`
  data set.
* Documentation is now provided for the `cop20OPU_data_pack_schema` data set.
