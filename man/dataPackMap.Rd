\title{Mapping of necessary Data Pack metadata}
\format{A data frame with metadata for each Operating Unit's Data Pack:
\describe{
  \item{data_pack_name}{Usually the same as Operating Unit, except in rare
  cases for some PEPFAR Regional Operating Units.}
  \item{model_uid}{Usually the same as Operating Unit, except in rare cases
  for some PEPFAR Regional Operating Units.}
  \item{country_name}{Name of country as stored in DATIM organization
  hierarchy}
  \item{country_uid}{Usually the organisationunituid as described in the DATIM
  organization unit hierarchy, uniquely identifying the Country listed in 
  \code{country_name}. For countries that are new to PEPFAR reporting in FY20
  and that were not logged in DATIM prior to the initial release of Data
  Packs, an arbitrary uid is assigned in this column for later re-mapping to
  DATIM.}
  \item{mil_psnu}{For all PEPFAR countries, this column lists the name of the
  _Military node.}
  \item{mil_psnu_uid}{For all countries with a _Military node, this column
  lists the DATIM organisationunituid. For _Military nodes not yet in DATIM
  (regional OU countries), lists "TBD".}
  \item{level3name}{Lists the \code{name} as used in level 3 of DATIM's
  organization unit hierarchy. For Regional OUs, this is the name of the
  Regional OU instead of the Country Name.}
  \item{uidlevel3}{Lists the \code{uid} as used in level 3 of DATIM's
  organization unit hierarchy. For Regional OUs, this is the uid of the
  Regional OU instead of the Country uid.}
  \item{level4name}{For countries in Regional OUs, lists the \code{name} as
  used in level 4 of DATIM's organization unit hierarchy. For Regional OUs,
  this is the name of the Country instead of the Regional OU.}
  \item{uidlevel4}{For countries in Regional OUs, lists the \code{uid} as
  used in level 4 of DATIM's organization unit hierarchy. For Regional OUs,
  this is the uid of the Country instead of the Regional OU.}
  \item{country_in_datim}{Documents whether the Country listed in 
  \code{country_name} was documented in DATIM's organization hierarchy as of
  Jan 8, 2019.}
  \item{mil_in_datim}{Documents (\code{TRUE}/\code{FALSE}) whether _Military
  node was present in DATIM as of Feb 20, 2019.}
  \item{is_region}{Logical (\code{TRUE}/\code{FALSE}) field documenting
  whether country in \code{country_name} is within a PEPFAR Regional OU.}
  \item{country}{Lists level in DATIM organization hierarchy where Country is
  designated.}
  \item{prioritization}{Lists level in DATIM organization hierarchy where
  prioritization occurs.}
  \item{planning}{Lists level in DATIM organization hierarchy where Country
  planning occurs.}
  \item{community}{Lists level in DATIM organization hierarchy where Community is
  designated.}
  \item{facility}{Lists level in DATIM organization hierarchy where Facility is
  designated.}
  \item{mil_level}{Level in DATIM organization hierarchy where _Military node
  is designated.}
