Using provided DATIM credentials, logs into DATIM to allow other functions to

non-production instances of DATIM. See Details for explanation. Where DATIM
credentials are not provided, uses Console and getPass to request these.

\details{
To securely connect with DATIM, create a JSON file structured as follows:

\preformatted{
{
  "dhis": {
      "baseurl": "https://www.datim.org/",
      "username": "example",
      "password": "3x@mpl3!"
   }
 }
}

Replace the username and password with yours, and save this file in a secure
location on your computer. For more details about how to setup a hidden
folder or file on your operating system, see:
https://www.howtogeek.com/194671/how-to-hide-files-and-folders-on-every-operating-system/

You can also save multiple versions of this login file to allow login to
multiple instances of DATIM. For example, a document saved as devDATIM.json:
\preformatted{
{
  "dhis": {
      "baseurl": "https://dev.datim.org/",
      "username": "example",
      "password": "3x@mpl3!"
   }
 }
}
}
